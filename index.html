                soon after, i joined musical academy,kept practicing and 3 years after <br>
                i performed with live audiences it was thrilling,but i had realised it wasn't <br>
                something i wanted to do for living. reasons being : money money and money .. <br>

        <h2>Me in Army</h2>

        <p>In my Country-Georgia when you turn 18 as a male, you get 2 choices,<br>

            Either you go to a university or you serve the contry for 1 year. <br>
            Me as an 18 year-old i chose the army path, since i ddnt really know what <br>
            i wanted to do with my life , what i wanted to study. <br>
            i wasnt negative about it, since i knew i would be getting paid decent ammount per month <br>
            and i would remain in shape (physically). <br>
            i passed the 2 month training , made friends, learnt how to operate weapons,got certificates <br> of few important weapons and thats where i thought my time there was over <br>
            and it was time to leave, so i did and started working in a casino, you can read about it <br> little further down

        </p>

            <br>

            <p>

            so, after leaving Georgian military, i applied for a job at Evolution gaming. <br>
            my duty was to present blackjack games professionaly,i did good job at it  <br>
            and got paid fair ammount. i had to wear formal uniform, as shown in the picture <br>
            it was definitely fun, but i decided to leave work and concentrate on what <br>
            i wanted to do as far as my career goes. I applied at Skill-Will Academy, which is <br>
            a college type environment for programming.

            &nbsp;learning for about to months and i love it. <br>
